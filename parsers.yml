#
# This file defines parser types for data sources to be read and transformed
# into a machine-readable format by publish.py
#
# A parser definition consists of a name, and a 'search' regular expression
# with a number of groups. These groups are read into independent variables
# in publish.py and serialised into JSON, then transmitted in STOMP format
# to a message queue.
# 
# A list of regexes are also specified which will be used to exclude lines
# received over the serial connection.
